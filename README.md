# PSHAT
(Pronounced "P'Shot") Part of Speech Handling for Aramaic Talmud

This is the official repo for Noah's Master's thesis, currently in Beta. You're welcome to help Noah finish his thesis by forking and submitting a pull request. Or you can wait for the full release.

This project aims to fill the gaping whole in ancient Aramaic POS tagging. It's actually spectacular that researchers haven't picked up on this field of research.
Anyway, I gratefully thank
